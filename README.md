FreeCodeCamp - Responsive Web Design Course - Building a Product Landing Page

From the FreeCodeCamp project description:"Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/RKRbwL."

I decided to go a bit further than the baseline webpage above and have some fun with the UI.
